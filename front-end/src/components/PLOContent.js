            <h4>Assessment of PLOs</h4>
            <p className="body-large">There are mainly two methods for assessing PLOs, i.e. indirect and direct, method. The PLOs are assessed indirectly using the feedback taken from employers and graduating students “alumni survey”. These methods form the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the PLOs.</p>
            <h4>Exit survey (Indirect Method)</h4>
            <p className="body-large">The graduating student exit survey is carried out at the end of every academic year by the graduating batch. The survey seeks graduating student input on quality of education they received in their program and the level of expertise they had gained during their stay at the university. The purpose of this survey is to assess the quality of the academic programs of the Department. The feedback on the relevant questions should be above 50% in order to clear this assessment strategy.</p>

            <h4>Employer's Survey (Indirect Method)</h4>
            <p className="body-large">Employers' survey form plays an important role in indirect assessment of PLOs. It is measured after the graduation. The feedback on the relevant questions should be above 50% in order to clear this assessment strategy.</p>

            <h4>Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) (Direct Method):</h4>
            <p className="body-large">The PLOs are assessed directly by evaluating the teaching learning methods of all courses. It is measured at the end of eighth semester. The assessment is based on PLO attainment (i.e. above 50%) for the graduating batch.</p>

            <h4>Teaching-Learning Methods:</h4>
            <p className="body-large">The CLOs that in turn define the PLOs are achieved through adopting the following methodologies: i.    Lectures / Discussions. ii.   Demonstrations. iii.  Videos / Animations. iv.  Exercises. v.   Seminars /Workshops. vi.  Internships. vii. Surveys.</p>

            <h4>Assessing Methods:</h4>
            <p className="body-large">Following assessment methods are adopted to realize the targeted CLOs: i.     Final Exam. ii.    Sessional Exams. iii.   Quizzes. iv.   Assignments. v.    Projects. vi.   Viva Voce. vii.  Presentation. viii. Class discussion / participation. Faculty members evaluate the students using a set of the above-mentioned assessment methods. The CLOs are linked with assessment methods by the faculty and a passing criteria of 50% is kept as the KPI. All students who have attained more than 50% marks in the weighted assessment method (e.g. Question 1 of Sessional 1 Exam and Question 1 of Final Exam for CLO2) are said to have attained the respective CLO. The CLOs are linked with the PLOs and if the weighted total of the student is above the KPI of 50%, the student has attained the respective PLO in that course. Students who have not achieved their PLOs are highlighted by the faculty member. Furthermore, the students are assessed in labs from lab performance, lab reports, lab projects and through conducting viva. The PLOs are assessed directly via the CLOs. The PLOs will be distributed over all the courses of the program. Each course has been allotted at least one of the cognitive, affective or psychomotor domains of the Blooms taxonomy. All the above assessment methods are mainly designed to comply with the Bloom's taxonomy, which comprises the following domains:</p>

            <h4>Cognitive Domain:</h4>
            <p className="body-large">The cognitive domain involves knowledge and the development of intellectual skills. There are six major categories of cognitive processes starting from the simplest to the most complex. Table lists these categories along with the relevant details.</p>
